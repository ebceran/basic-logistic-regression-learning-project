Basic Logistic Regression Learning Project

A hands-on mini project to understand the foundations of Logistic Regression, the most widely used model in finance, banking, and fintech.

*  Purpose of This Project

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into Machine Learning for Finance.
Although this is a small project, it represents something very important:

- understanding the core statistical logic behind risk models
- learning how ML algorithms actually behave—not just running code
- building the foundational mindset required for real banking/fintech analytics

Almost every financial institution uses Logistic Regression as the backbone of:

credit scoring

fraud detection

anti-money laundering (AML) systems

customer churn prediction

risk classification

regulatory modelling (FCA, PRA)

Before building complex models, I wanted to truly understand how logistic regression combines multiple features into a single probability score.

This project demonstrates that learning process.

* What This Project Covers
1. Creating a simple synthetic dataset

Features used:

Age

Income

Number of late payments

These represent common risk indicators in credit scoring and fraud analytics.

2. Training a Logistic Regression model

The model predicts whether a customer:

1 = will default

0 = will not default

This closely mirrors real-world credit risk modelling.

3. Interpreting coefficients

A key requirement in finance is that models must be:

explainable

transparent

regulator-friendly

Logistic Regression provides direction (positive/negative effect) and magnitude for each input.
In this project, for example:

Late payments strongly increase risk

Age slightly reduces risk

Income reduces risk

Understanding this behaviour is essential in financial modelling.

4. Visualizing the probability curve

The project includes a sigmoid probability curve, showing how increasing late payments rapidly elevates default probability.

This is exactly how banks visualize model behaviour during validation.

* Why Logistic Regression Is Essential in Finance

Banks and fintech companies rely heavily on logistic regression because:

- It produces clear, interpretable probabilities

- It aligns with regulatory expectations (FCA, PRA, Basel III)

- It works well even with small datasets

- It provides directionality (risk increases / decreases)

- It avoids black-box decisions

- Most scoring engines still use it today

Even modern machine learning pipelines in fintech start with Logistic Regression as the baseline model.

This project is my way of mastering that baseline.

* What I Learned

Through this mini project, I learned:

how multiple features combine into a single risk score

how a logit transformation works

how probability outputs are generated

how to read model coefficients

how to visualize model behaviour

how to document and structure a learning-focused GitHub project

These are the exact skills needed in real-world roles such as:

Financial Data Analyst

Risk Analyst

Credit Modelling Analyst

Fraud Analyst

Fintech Product Analyst

ML Ops (Fintech)

Data Scientist (Banking)


 *Next Steps

This project is the first stepping stone.
Over the coming months, I plan to build:

real financial datasets

fraud detection simulations

risk scoring models

time-series forecasting projects

a complete Financial Data Scientist learning portfolio

Each project will build on top of this foundation.
